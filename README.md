I made a series of uni, bi, and multivariate plots of Pew online dating data, interspersed with observations.  I also built a simple decision tree classifier, that predicts if someone has tried online dating or not, using features related to social proof and marital status.

The Rmd file was made in RStudio, and converted to html using R's knitr package.  Both the 2005 and 2013 datasets can be found [here](http://www.pewinternet.org/datasets/).
